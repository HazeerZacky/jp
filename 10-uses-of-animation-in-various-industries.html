					<p>The animation is an imitation of real-world characters and objects through moving pictures. Still images moving at a certain number of frames per second lead to an illusion of continuous motion. Animation has evolved tremendously since its inception. Majority of animations are developed using CGI or computer-generated images.</p>
					<p>The animation effect is achieved by moving images sequentially in quick succession. The difference between two consecutive images is made minimal so that the human eye fails to understand the same during the transition of images.</p>
