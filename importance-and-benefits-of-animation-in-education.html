					<p>The education system has a very important role in shaping the perceptions and characters of students who will lead the world in various capacities in the future. The comprehension needs of these youngsters can no longer be completely fulfilled by conventional learning framework as it is at par with the latest pedagogic trends.</p>
					<blockquote>The quality of education can be improved with the incorporation of animations in classroom teaching. Benefits of animation in education are well-known. Any concept can be presented in a live and visual manner. It is scientifically proved that a process dynamically and virtually illustrated can be retained in memory for a longer duration compared to oral memorizing.</blockquote>
					<p>Moreover, animated educational videos take the boredom away from learning. The limited attention span or lack of concentration can be overcome which most students suffer. If you observe the habits of children closely, you will find that they take great delight in watching and sharing memes, videos on social sites, gifs, etc. This implies that animated content leaves a deep-rooted impression on the intellect of children.</p>
					<p>The importance of animation for children can be seen in the educational field. In classrooms, animated learning material can be used for a variety of purposes, like</p>
					<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Explaining complex and challenging concepts in easy to understand manner</p>
					<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Making learning an enjoyable experience for even poorly performing students</p>
					<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &#9679; &nbsp; Presenting things in completely new outlook</p>
					<p>The role of animation in developing an interest in learning in students is supreme. It is important that parents and other stakeholders should promote the cause of including <a href="educational.html">animation in learning</a>.</p>
					<h2>Ways to Incorporate Animation in Children’s Education</h2>
					<p>The benefits that can be obtained by the incorporation of <a href="educational.html">animation in education</a> are many. This provided us the ways to include animation in learning pursuits. The different ways are discussed below.</p>
					<h3>Animation of Subject-based topics</h3>
					<p>Various chapters of different subjects like science, mathematics, English, etc. can be animated to relate the students with the concepts taught. Complex topics can be presented in a visual manner with fun bits reducing the challenges in understanding the topics.</p>
					<p>Course modules can be viewed any number of times as required by a student to handle the subject complexities. The animation is captured easily in the brain for a longer time as compared to normal videos. Animation can be modified and updated over a period of time to include any changes.</p>
					<h3>Class presentations enhanced</h3>
					<p>Teachers would now be more value-added with the help of animations. The interactive classes will keep students focused. Visual interaction would encourage more participation from students.</p>
					<p>Students will be motivated to know more about topics. Thoughts and ideas can be presented with slide shows.</p>
					<h3>Visualizations made easy and attentive</h3>
					<p>Many topics are more complex and require more focused teaching efforts to provide clarity to students. Animated topic videos with 3D animation can be used to provide detailed information and explanation about such topics. Multimedia components like audio, video, images, and texts can be blended together to make complex topics easier to understand. Students with varying IQ levels can understand the topics with ease.</p>
					<p>With animations, topics that baffle mind can be easily articulated. Multimedia presentations can help students to visualize the concepts and get understand them in an easy manner. The imagination of young minds can be broadened using animation.</p>
					<h3>Making classes available as required</h3>
					<p>Traditional classrooms are confined to rooms and schools. Students have to attend the classes for fixed time irrespective of whether they learned and understood the topic or not. With animated learning modules, topics can be published online allowing students to learn as their own comfort and pace.</p>
					<p>Animated lessons can be learned from any location. Access to resources can be made available from the school, home, library or any place with access to the internet. This provides encouragement for learning at ease and anywhere. Animations can be combined with background music to calm the mind and improve focus on learning.</p>
					<h3>Removing the age factor in learning</h3>
					<p>Learners of any age groups can benefit from interactive animated learning modules. Varied approaches are available for students of kindergarten, school and university learners. The exciting and attention-catching animations are appealing to all age groups.</p>
					<p>Teachers can improve productivity and make learning more efficient by using various approaches available for different age groups. Animations allow topics to be stored in memory easily for a long period of time. Using narratives, sound and nerve-calming music adds more power to learning. Every learner can connect to the topic and the brain will respond with much ease to learning complex topics. Animated material will stimulate the senses.</p>
					<h3>Freedom to express</h3>
					<p>Students often feel shy or self-conscious in expressing or speaking how they feel when learning. The presences of better minds inhibit their energies and expressions are suppressed.</p>
					<p>Animation can offer a simple solution to such problems in education. Characters are created and available in environments which are illustrated beforehand. With the option to learn from anywhere and multiple times, one can freely express their doubts and feeling. Students can participate and discuss with more ease. Many companies are promoting animated study materials developed for usage in schools and universities. Teachers can use the management features available with such a course to deliver more efficient and easy learning.</p>
					<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
					<p>Multiple studies have proved animation to be a medium effective to facilitate better learning technique in students/learners. However, learning modules must be designed comprehensively to achieve the desired output. Experts in specialized domains are required to achieve a successful outcome.</p>
					<p>Stimulating and attentive learning modules can be developed in conjunction with experts along with using the latest <a href="https://beststudios.in2danimation.html/">2d and 3d animation</a> techniques with supporting multimedia components. This will enhance teaching to a new level.</p>
					<p>Students and learners of any age group will be motivated and move with easy to realize their true potential.</p>
